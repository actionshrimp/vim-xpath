CHANGES                                                         *xpath-changes*

This is a complete rewrite of v1. The plugin now:

- Uses vim's built in |location-list| to display results, rather than
  implementing its own.
- Properly supports XML namespaces through prefix detection / configuration,
  rather than just hacking things with XPath's local-name().
- Supports line numbers in the results on XML files larger than 65536 lines
  long. This is a bug in the underlying XML library, that is worked around in a
  reliable way.
- No longer supports auto-completion of xpaths. This isn't really supported by
  the underlying XML library, and was previously a bit of a hack. It might be
  re-added again at some point in the future.

INSTALLATION                                               *xpath-installation*

To install the plugin, extract the directory structure into your vimfiles, or 
use your preferred plugin manager (vundle, pathogen etc.)

For the plugin to run, you'll need python installed, and your vim distribution
needs to have been built with python support enabled. You can check this with
|:version|, and looking for |+python| (|+python3| may work, but is untested).

You'll also need python-lxml installed (http://lxml.de).  This should be
installed by default on OSX (although the version may be fairly old?), and can
be installed on ubuntu with apt-get install python-lxml.

If any of these requirements are unmet the plugin will let you know on startup,
then stop loading.

USAGE                                            *:XPathSearchPrompt* *xpath-usage*

XPath search defines several functions, but the main interface to the plugin 
is through the :XPathSearchPrompt command, which launches the search input 
prompt against the current buffer (which needs to contain valid XML).

You may want to map the command to a key if it's something you use a lot - this
will map F5 to the command:

noremap <F5> XPathSearchPrompt

After the command has been invoked, the search prompt appears and you can begin
typing an XPath. The location list will also appear to display results. Results
will appear for matches as you type an XPath.

If you're done typing, hit enter to complete the search, and if the XPath
expression evaluates to a node or node-set, the buffer being searched against
will jump to the first match. You can jump between matches using the location
list commands such as |:lnext| and |:lprev|. (I recommend tpope's
unimpaired.vim plugin for a great set of mappings for commands like these -
with it installed, ]l and [l will be mapped to |:lnext| and |:lprev|
respectively which make navigating the list very easy. Get the plugin at
https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired).

If the XML file is not valid, the plugin will let you know of any XML 
validation errors. 

When you hit enter to complete a search, the XPath will be added to a search
history. Use CTRL+h in the prompt to open a history popup of previous search
results.

Namespaces
----------

If your document contains elements which are declared as being in a particular
namespace (either through a default namespace, declared with "xmlns", or more
explicitly through the use of a prefix, decalred with "xmlns:prefixName"), the
XPath evaluator requires that you have a prefix defined for the namespace URL in
question. Note that namespace prefixes defined in the document being searched
are distinct from those in the XPaths being evaluated.

The plugin supports some very simplistic prefix detection - the document is
scanned and "xmlns" and "xmlns:prefixName" attributes are loaded into a
buffer-specific prefix dictionary. All namespaces require a prefix in xpath
(there is no support for a default namespace apart from the unqualified
namespace), so the first unprefixed "xmlns" is assigned the prefix 'default'.
You can view the prefix dictionary that has been auto-detected through the
*:XPathShowPrefixes* command, and you can edit it by changing the buffer-specific
b:ns_prefixes variable with:

let b:ns_prefixes["my_prefix"] = "http://someurl.org"

As an example, for this XML:

<Root xmlns:ns="http://prefixed.org">
    <NamespaceFreeTag/>
    <DefaultNamespacedBlock xmlns="http://default.org">
        <DefaultNamespaced/>
    </DefaultNamespacedBlock>
    <ns:Prefixed/>
</Root>

The following XPaths should match a tag using the prefix detection's
conventions:

1.  //NamespaceFreeTag 

as it is in the unqualified, 'blank' namespace.

2.  //default:DefaultNamespaced 

as the detection gives the first 'default' xmlns attribute namespace in the
document the 'default' prefix.

3.  //ns:Prefixed

as the detection gives the first xmlns:prefixName attribute that defines a
prefix the specified prefix.

If there were multiple conflicting definitions for the "ns" prefix, and default
namespace, these would have to be resolved manually by editing the b:ns_prefixes
variable.

You can also set commonly used, global prefixes shared between all buffers by
setting the g:ns_prefixes dictionary in a similar way, perhaps in your vimrc.
For example:

let g:ns_prefixes { "xsl": "http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" }

Global prefixes will be merged into the buffer-specific prefix list during
prefix detection.

===============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                                 *xpath-configure*

To disable the plugin for certain situtations, (e.g. to hide the startup
messages if you don't have certain required dependencies installed) add the
following in your |vimrc|:

let g:skip_xpath = 1

Common namespaces can be configured globally by defining a g:ns_prefixes
variable:

let g:ns_prefixes { "xsl": "http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" }

These prefixes can then always be used in your XPaths to refer to tags in a
common namespace.
